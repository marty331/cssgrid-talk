# CSS Grid

## Definition
CSS Grid is a two-dimentional grid-based layout system.  

## Previous Tooling
Before Grid existed there were plenty of options for developers to layout web pages, such as these fairly simple options - tables, floats, positioning, inline-block.  Flexbox is a better option but it only provides one-directional flow.  Each of these elements still have their use cases today and are not irrelavant.

## Advantages
- Grid solves the need for many of the hacks that were needed for the previous elements to work. 
- Provides an easy way to structure elements on a page.
